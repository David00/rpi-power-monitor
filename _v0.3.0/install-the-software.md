## Software Installation

For most users, you can download the custom OS image here:

< LINK > 

This image has everything pre-installed.  It is the stock Raspberry Pi OS Lite image with all the dependencies pre-installed.  Simply download the file and use Raspberry Pi Imager to write the image to your microSD card.

For advanced users, you can install the software manually. Please see the README.md in the projecty repository. I do not recommend using a Desktop OS image with this project.


### Setup

In v0.3.0, I introduced a new configuration file named `config.toml`. This file is included in the custom OS image, but has to be created if you chose the manual install method.
