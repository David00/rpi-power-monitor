# Plugin for the Power Monitor for Raspberry Pi
# Plugin Name: GPIO Controller (Example)
# Author: David00
# Description: This plugin is an example plugin for developers to reference when adding or extending the functionality of the base RPI Power Monitor project. 
# It will set the state of a GPIO pin based on the last reading of the power monitor.
# The plugin demonstrates several key components:
# - accessing the plugin configuration from config.toml
# - accessing the latest power monitor data
# - logging to the terminal
#
# See the docs for more info on writing plugins: https://david00.github.io/rpi-power-monitor/docs/v0.3.0/plugins.html

def start_plugin(data, stop_flag, config, logger, *args, **kwargs):
    '''This function should start your plugin and contain a While True loop if your plugin is designed to be constantly running.
    
    This function will be called if the plugin is enabled in the power monitor's config.toml, and it will be started as a child process, owned by the main power monitor process.

    The following parameters are provided from the power monitor itself:
        - data: a dictionary containing the latest power monitor data. See below for the structure.
        - stop_flag: a multiprocessing.Event() object that your plugin must check the status for in order to know when to stop.
        - config: the plugins config from config.toml, parsed into a dictionary.
        - logger: a Python logger object, specific this plugin. Your plugin can use this logger to log any important messages or debugs to the console.

    A plugin's while loop should run until either:
        - the stop_flag is set, or
        - your plugin has finished its task and is not intended to run indefinitely.

    Here is the full structure of the data dictionary, with real sample values. 

    Here are the units used:
        'power'   : Always in Watts
        'pf'      : A float between the range of -1.0 and 1.0
        'current' : Always in Amperes
        'voltage' : Always in Volts
