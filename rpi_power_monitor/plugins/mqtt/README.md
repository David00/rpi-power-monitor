## Purpose

The MQTT plugin allows you to export power monitor data to a MQTT-capable system. 

## Setup & Usage
You'll need to install the paho mqtt client to use this plugin:
    
    pip install paho-mqtt


The following configuration block needs to be added to the power monitor's `config.toml` file

```toml

[plugins.mqtt]
    enabled = true
    host = "192.168.x.x"
    username = "username"
    password = "password"
    prefix = "powermon"
    refresh = 5 # Refresh rate in seconds

```

This plugin will send all measurements for all channels to the host specified above.
