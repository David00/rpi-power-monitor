# Case for Power Monitor HAT factory assembled for the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

This is a case you can print for the factory assembled HAT running on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

---

## Features

The case includes holes for the standard Pi 4 Model B ports and in addition side holes that match those on the HAT. Also, the cover features an opening for the top screws of the terminal block.

Standoffs can be printed to raise the case off the surface it is installed on.

Tight clip fitment for the Raspberry Pi. It will be hard to remove the project from the case once clipped in place. Make sure the hat and any required heat sinks on the Pi are installed prior to fitting it into the case. It is also recommended to install the metal standoffs for the hat and insert the Pi without the hat installed.

## How to print ?

I have tested the build on Flash Forge Adventurer 4.

Supports are required for the case. Don't forget under the protruding clips near the USB C and audio port of the Pi.

The standsoffs can be glued using a drop of crazy glue.
